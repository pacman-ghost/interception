This project is still a WIP, so the installation process and usage is a bit messy.

(*) Install the mouse driver (see $/_ARCHIVE_/removal/).

(*) Build the solution and grab MouseInterception.exe and mouse.dll.
    You will also need interception.dll.
    
(*) Set up a config.xml and configure it (examples are in this directory).
    You need to know the device number and HID for each mouse/trackball you want to configure. The easiest way to get these is to run MouseInterception.exe from the console, and then move the device - MouseInterception.exe will then log the details you need.

(*) If you have trouble getting things to work, create a DEBUG.INI file that looks something like this:
        [Logging]
        ;LogFilename = r:\MouseInterception.log
        system = 1
        config = 1
        ;events = 1
        ;actions = 1
        ;rawEvents = 1
        ;detectMouseMove = 1
        ;sendInput = 1
